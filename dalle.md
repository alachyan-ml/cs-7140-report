# DALLE-2 

This page will discuss the fundamentals and building blocks that are described in the DALLE-2 paper and model release. 

## Motivation and Background

We start by motivating the problem that DALLE-2 solves for: Image Generation. In A.I., we've seen various models that fall under the image generation objective:

- Generative Adversarial Networks (GANS)
- Autoencoders (AE) and Variational Autoencoders (VAEs)
- Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs)

But why would image generation be a useful task? Many might say that it is a well suited problem for ML models because there are various easily supervisable datasets and experiments that are part of image generation as well as this domain suits blending understandings of Natural Language and Computer vision to understand how the two are understood by current ML models. From a commercial perspective, we see that there is a large demand for new content especially in the graphic design and digital art space and ML models make it seamless and extremely easy to quickly prototype or brainstorm designs for a variety of tasks whether it be logo generation, marketing content creation and the like. 

Now that we have some background of
